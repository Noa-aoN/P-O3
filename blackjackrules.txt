Rules Blackjack

The aim of Blackjack is to finish the game with a higher total than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21.
Going over 21 is commonly known as busting and means an automatic loss.

All number cards (2-10) score the value indicated on them.
The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) score 10 points and Ace can either be treated as 1 or 11.

At the beginning of each round, all players place their bets in their betting positions - also known as boxes.
After the bets have been placed, all players are dealt two cards face-up in front of their respective betting positions.
The dealer receives two cards, one face-up and another face-down.

Starting to the left of the dealer, each player is given a chance to draw more cards.
The players can either HIT, DOUBLE DOWN or STAND.
If the player calls out HIT, they are given an extra card.
They can then either call out HIT again, or STAND if they do not wish to draw any more cards.
The player can HIT as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to bust (exceed a total of 21).
********
After receiving the first two cards, players can double their bet while hitting. When doubling down, player receives one extra card only and cannot hit again.

If the player busts, they immediately lose their bet.

After each player has played and either stood or busted, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either HIT or STAND.
If the dealer cards exceeds 21, all players who didnt bust win immediately
- their bet is returned along with a matching amount from the dealers bank.
If the dealer reaches a valid hand, the cards are totalled and each players hand is compared to the dealers.
If the player scored higher than the dealer, they win.
If the player ties with the dealer, the original bet is returned to the player. Otherwise, the player loses their bet.

A perfect hand combines an ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a Blackjack.
