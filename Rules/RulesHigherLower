Rules Higher Lower

The dealer gives you one card. You need to guess if the next card is higher or lower.
If you guessed correct, the game continues. If you guessed wrong the game ends.
If the next card is the same rank then the current card, the game continues.

e.g The given card is a 5, you guess that the next card will be higher.
If next card is a 5 or higher you win. If the next card is a 4 or lower you lose.

You can choose higher or lower by pressing on the right button or by gesture.

Gestures:
            Index finger down = lower
            Index finger up = higher
