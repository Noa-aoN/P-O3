Rules Blackjack

The aim of Blackjack is to finish the game with a higher total than that of the dealer, without exceeding 21.
Going over 21 is commonly known as busting and means an automatic loss.

All number cards (2-10) score the value indicated on them.
The face cards (Jack, Queen, King) score 10 points and Ace can either be treated as 1 or 11.

At the beginning of each round, all players place their bets.
After the bets have been placed, all players are dealt two cards face-up. The dealer receives two cards, one face-up and another face-down.

Starting on the left, each player is given a chance to draw more cards. The players can either HIT (index finger up), DOUBLE DOWN (two fingers) or STAND(five fingers).
If the player calls out HIT, they are given an extra card.
The player can HIT as many times as they wish, but have to aim not to bust (exceed a total of 21).

After receiving the first two cards, players can double their bet while hitting.
When doubling down, player receives one last card and cannot hit again.

If the player busts, they immediately lose the round.

After each player has played and either stood or busted, the dealer takes their turn. They can, again, either HIT or STAND.
If the dealer cards exceeds 21, all players who didn't bust win immediately
- their bet is returned along with a matching amount from the dealers bank.
If the dealer reaches a valid hand, the cards are totalled and each players hand is compared to the dealers.
If the player scored higher than the dealer, they win and will be paid their bet times 2.
If the player ties with the dealer, the original bet is returned to the player. Otherwise, the player loses their bet.

A perfect hand combines an ace with a 10, Jack, Queen or King and is known as a Blackjack.
If the dealer has BlackJack, all players lose the round. When players wins with BlackJack, they will earn their bet times 2,5.
